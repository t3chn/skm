# SKM Constitution

## Purpose
SKM (Spec-Kit Manager) is an intelligent meta-agent for managing portfolios of development projects following the Spec-Kit methodology.

## Core Values

### 1. Visibility First
Every project in the portfolio should be instantly observable and understandable. No hidden complexities.

### 2. Prioritization Matters
Not all projects need equal attention. SKM must surface what needs human intervention most urgently.

### 3. Automation with Control
Automate what's safe, but always keep humans in the loop for critical decisions.

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
Start simple (scan and report) and progressively add intelligence (RAG, automation, handoff).

## Principles

1. **Spec-Kit Native**: Deep understanding of Spec-Kit methodology and conventions
2. **Portfolio-Centric**: Manage multiple projects as a cohesive portfolio
3. **Human-Augmented**: Enhance human decision-making, don't replace it
4. **Context-Preserving**: Maintain rich context for effective agent handoffs
5. **Safety-First Automation**: Clear automation levels (L0-L3) with appropriate safeguards

## Boundaries

- SKM manages Spec-Kit projects exclusively
- SKM does not execute code without explicit permission
- SKM preserves existing project structures and workflows
- SKM respects git repositories and never auto-commits
